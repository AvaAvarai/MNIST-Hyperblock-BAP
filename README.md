# MNIST-Hyperblock-BAP

Structured MNIST dimensional and case reduction for interpretable hyperblock classification and lossless geometric visualization.

This repository offers a modular Python pipeline for MNIST data processing. Each step produces outputs for further analysis, with all datasets and results stored in the automatically created data/ directory. The data/ folder is not included in the repository; it will be generated by the scripts as needed.

To use download_mnist_csv.py, you need a Kaggle account with a legacy API credentials key (username and key) from the legacy credential generation page. These credentials can be used via a kaggle.json file or directly as environment variables, as described in python_scripts/download_mnist_csv.py. The kaggle.json file is convenient but not strictly required.

## Data Source

This repository uses the MNIST dataset, publicly available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/683/mnist+database+of+handwritten+digits).

For all experiments in this repository, we use a preprocessed CSV-format version of the MNIST dataset. This version is hosted on Kaggle and provides the digit images as flattened arrays, with each row representing a single handwritten digit and its class label. You can download it from Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv).

The dataset is not redistributed in this repository.
