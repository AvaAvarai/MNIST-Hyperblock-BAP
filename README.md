# MNIST-Hyperblock-BAP

Structured MNIST dimensional and case reduction for interpretable hyperblock classification and lossless geometric visualization.

The repository is organized as a modular Python pipeline. Each stage produces analyzable outputs, culminating in datasets suitable for Visual Knowledge Discovery.

## Data Source

This repository uses the MNIST dataset, publicly available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/683/mnist+database+of+handwritten+digits).

The specific CSV-formatted version used in experiments is available via Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv).

The dataset is not redistributed in this repository.
